Difficulties we had: 
The most difficult thing for us was the skinning of the mesh of the snake (it took time setting up and moving the snake in space).
We also had a bit of difficulty with the skybox camera where we needed to move the "sky" according to the snake's movement.

What we did:
We fully implemented all of the required features (75 percent) and for the optional part we:
1) Moved the objects the snake needs to pick up according to randomized bezier curves.
2) Added background music for the menus and levels.
3) Objects move faster according to a cue from the backgroudn music.
4) Interactive gui for the menus and a timer showing the time left in the level and the points acquired in the current level.
5) Skybox of a beautiful sunny day.
6) We also have our own kind of powerups (speed up, speed down, bonus points and an object which deducts points upon pick up).
